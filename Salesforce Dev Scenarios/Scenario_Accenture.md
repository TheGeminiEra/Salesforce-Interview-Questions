💼 These are the real questions Accenture asked me:
🔹 How do you handle failures when an API is down? Retry logic?
 🔹 Explain a real-time use case for Platform Events vs Outbound Messaging.
 🔹 How do you receive external webhooks in Salesforce securely?
 🔹 Have you worked with Named Credentials + OAuth? How did you use it?
 🔹 How do you ensure governor limits don’t break a high-volume integration?
 🔹 How do you test REST integrations in Apex?
 🔹 When do you recommend middleware like MuleSoft or Boomi in your projects?
🧠 What I built to prepare:
✅ Retry framework with Queueable
 ✅ Error logging with Custom Object + Status Tracking
 ✅ @RestResource webhook listener + security token validation
 ✅ External Services + Flows (no-code integration)
 ✅ Test classes with HttpCalloutMock
