🔁 Contact vs Subscriber in SFMC – Know the Difference!

In Salesforce Marketing Cloud (SFMC), both Contacts and Subscribers are essential for personalized communication — but they’re not the same! 👇

✅ Subscriber
A subscriber is someone who receives messages via a specific channel like Email or SMS. Stored in Lists or Data Extensions, each subscriber has a Subscriber Key (usually email or unique ID).
📧 Example: A person who subscribes to your email newsletter.

✅ Contact
A contact represents a person in the broader Contact Model — across multiple channels like Email, SMS, Push, and even WhatsApp! Every contact has a Contact Key and can exist even if they never received a message yet.
🌐 Example: Someone added to a Journey via a data extension, but hasn’t received any communication yet. 

💡 Best Practice:
Use Contact Key = Subscriber Key for consistency across channels and avoid duplication/conflicts in your journeys.
